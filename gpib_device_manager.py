# 1.3 Created serverConnected() to identify devices on a given server once
#     it has completed its registration with the LabRAD manager. Before this
#     device registration would fail if the server had a custom IDN handling
#     function because this setting could not be properly accessed through the
#     LabRAD manager at the time of execution.
